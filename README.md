 # <b>MODIFIED Spy Addon for Turtle WoW by Meow - Got the whole addon to work again, if you find bugs just send me a PM - Originally from https://github.com/momomeomo/Spy-vanilla</b>
# Spy-vanilla for TurtleWoW
Spy ported to vanilla WOW Spy-vanilla from: https://github.com/laytya/Spy-vanilla

Original keeps erroring in AceComm-3.0 library file: ChatThrottleLib.lua so I commented out the errors. Works now on TurtleWoW but I don't know how to fix the underlying issue.

Version 1.1 - Fixed pets being shown as enemy players in the frames.
