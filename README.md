Spy ported to vanilla WOW Spy-vanilla from: https://github.com/laytya/Spy-vanilla

Version 1.1 - Fixed hunter pets being shown as enemy players in the frames.

Version 1.2 - Added Zone "Nordanaar" to "Disable Spy while in these locations"

Version 1.3 - Fixed the error spam in chat when entering dungeons.

Version 1.4 - Fixed minimap button not being shown properly.

Version 1.5 - Spy will now only trigger and show an enemy arround if they are pvp flagged. (This is to prevent on the PvE realm for the addon to spam)
